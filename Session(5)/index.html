        <h1>About Messi's Career</h1>
<p>Messi has achieved many great things in his career with Barca, taking it as an example that he had achieved the number of 4 total champions league titles and having more trophies (40) than other big teams with great history in the past decade and a half.</p>
<p>But not only did he accomplish things in the green pitch only, he also did manage somehow to accomplish many great things in his personal life.</p>
<p>We can take his mairrage and marrying his dream girl since the Argentine was a young boy in Rosario, Angelina as an example because ever since they were young, there was some sort of a very firm bond between them both, and ever since Messi was 9, and she was 10, they haven't seen each other.</p>
<p>But now, they are married and now they have 3 kids.</p>
